"`- This is not ``creative``.  Those are the dictionary definitions of the terms ``insurance`` and ``ensurance`` as properly applied to ``destruction``.  If you don't understand that, fine, legitimate criticism, I'll write up ``three man cell`` and ``bounty hunter`` and then it will be easy to understand why ``ensured`` and ``insured`` are different - and why both differ from ``assured``.  The sentence you quote is absolutely neutral.  You just aren't familiar with the underlying theory of strike-back (e.g. submarines as employed in nuclear warfare) guiding the insurance, nor likely the three man cell structure that kept the IRA from being broken by the British.  If that's my fault, fine, I can fix that to explain.  But ther'es nothing ``personal`` or ``creative`` about it.  I'm tired of arguing with you.  Re: the other article, ``multi-party`` turns up plenty, and there is more use of ``mutually`` than ``mutual``.  If I were to apply your standard I'd be moving ``Mutual Assured Destruction`` to ``talk`` for not appealing to a Reagan voter's biases about its effectiveness, and for dropping the ``ly``.  There is a double standard in your edits.  If it comes from some US history book, like ``peace movement`` or 'M.A.D.' as defined in 1950, you like it, even if the definition is totally useless in 2002 and only of historical interest.    If it makes any even-obvious connection or implication from the language chosen in multiple profession-specific terms, you consider it somehow non-neutral...  Gandhi thinks ``eye for an eye`` describes riots, death penalty, and war all at once, but you don't.  What do you know that Gandhi doesn't?  Guess what:  reality is not neutral.  Current use of terms is slightly more controversial.  Neutrality requires negotiation, and some willingness to learn.  This is your problem not mine.  You may dislike the writing, fine, that can be fixed.  But disregarding fundamental axioms of philosphy with names that recur in multiple phrases, or failing to make critical distinctions like 'insurance' versus 'assurance' versus 'ensurance' (which are made in one quote by an Air Force general in an in-context quote), is just a disservice to the reader.  If someone comes here to research a topic like MAD, they want some context, beyond history.  If this is a history book, fine, it's a history book.  But that wasn't what it was claimed to be... `",0

"`:If you ever claimed in a Judaic studies program that ultra-Orthodox Jews don't have rabbis, or don't have synagogues, you would be laughed out of the room.   ::I am beginning to see the problem you have. You see, you do not know how to read what other people say without attaching your personal bias to it. Never once did I say that ultra-Orthodox Jews have no rabbis or synagogues. I DID say that the role of the rabbi and synagogue in ultra-Orthodox Judaism is minimal when compared with, say, Conservative Judaism. They are not clergy, in the traditional Western sense of the word. That is a fact. As for synagogues, they exist, but they are not essential. Minyan (a quorum of ten adult males in ultra-Orthodox law) is essential. You can have a minyan without a synagogue, but a synagogue without a minyan is an empty building. You can laugh all you want, but it doesnt change the facts. It may seem strange to you, but take the statement to anyone who actually knows something. I want to know who laughs then.   :If you ever claimed in a recognized Judaica studies program that a significant number of ultra-Orthodox rabbis accept and follow Modern Orthodox responsa (instead of their own), people would look at you as if you had two heads.   ::Also a silly point. If you were to draw such sharp distinctions between ultra-Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism in a recognized Judaic Studies program, they would not know what you are talking about. A) That statement is false, because responsa in Orthodoxy does not work on the basis of someone's synagogue affiliation. B) What is a Modern Orthodox responsa versus an ultra-Orthodox responsa? C) In cases where things like hashgacha (kosher certification, etc.) are debated, you will find in most cases that it is not a question of responsa. If you know something about responsa literature in general (which apparently you do not), there are degrees of acceptance. For example, halav yisrael (milk under rabbinical supervision during milking to ensure that it comes from a cow). Most modern-Orthodox Jews do not insist on it t on the basis of a responsa by Rabbi Moshe Feinstein who determined that American government supervision is sufficient. Most ultra-Orthodox Jews do insist on it. They do not reject the responsa. In fact, Moshe Feinstein (Reb Moshe, as he was called) was considered the leading halachic authority for the American ultra-Orthodox community in the past fifty years. They will say that the ruling is right BUT they want to be machmir (more strict on themselves, meaning more pious). It is not a rejection. It is simply being stricter.

"` Changed Macedonia link to Macedon; ancients didn't call their land Macedonia, and the entry we have on ``Macedonia`` isn't useful for Alexander.

Just a note about the relationship between Aristotle and Alexander. Those two were two different personalities and they used to clash a lot but Alexander did something that makes me wanter if their relationship was as bad as people think today. While he was invading Asia he would send to his teacher all new and interesting animals that he would incounter in his expedition because he knew that old Aristotle was almost obsessed with the classification of things. The result was that Aristotle formed a kind of a zoo back in Macedonia from the gifts of his student. Now, if young Alexander was so sick of his teacher why did he bother?    Good point.  I think Alexander was complicated enough that trying to determine who he liked and who he didn't (and which was safer) isn't all that easy.  He was known to treat his enemies rather well and to kill his friends when they ticked him off.  I think he might have respected Aristotle and just not wanted to spend time around him anymore.

"`   I cut the following paragraph, which misleads people about biology: :A few points are worth clarifying about ``nature`` and ``nurture``. First, ``nature`` does not reduce to anything as simple as ``present at birth``. Height is thought to depend very extensively on genetics, for example, but one is not born adult-sized; one must slowly grow up.  The problem is clear in the example: height certainly does manifest itself over time as one ages.  But insofar as height has a ``natural`` component, it is' present at birth in the genome.  It is just that whatever genes code for height do not manifest themselves immediately.  But they are there at birth.  The real problem with using height as an example of something that is ``nature`` but not immediately manifest at birth is that height is of course determined by ``nature`` and'' ``nurture,`` or, if you prefer, genes and environment.  this is the whole point of Boas's important studies on height; height is clearly highly heritable, but children of immigrants to the US had much higher average adult heights than their parents, presumably because of better nutrition in the US.  I believe nature is best understood as things that are indeed innate (present at birth) as long as we recognize that things that are present at birth genetically may manifest themselves over time.  How else are we to distinguish a physical feature like height (that heritable part of it) from physical features like scars  which appear later in life and do mark the body noticably, but which are clearly not ``natural?`` `",0

I've always been an advocate of approaching writing a Wikipedia article as if everything you're writing about happened a thousand years ago and is ancient history, because it seems to me that's the proper style for an encyclopaedia, which is intended to be timeless and authoritative. ``Neologism`` is an inescapably relative word - *all* words are neologisms looked at from one perspective in time, soon after they are invented. (All the words Shakespeare invented would be neologisms if you lived in 1630, for instance).

Totalitarian ideologies and fanaticisms have come in gone and have been defeated by America. All these ideologies are one in the same. They hate modernity, hate America, hate freedom, hate capitalism, hate liberal democracy, and love terrorism, oppression, genoicide, and fanatic hatred. In Germany the tyranical enemies of freedom and capitalism rallied behind Nazism, in Italy they rallied behind fascism, in Russia they rallied behind totalitarian socialism and communism, and now in the Middle East, where a lot of dictators and tyrants are threatened by freedom and American values, they rally behind militant Islamics. It is fact that there isnt a single Arab democracy. Muslim leaders (Saddam was just the worst of the lot. There will be more dictators/terrorists to fight like the Syrians) are all tyrants and terrorists who stifle the free press, kill their own people, crush their citizens hopes and dreams, and want to kill Americans like they did on 9/11. Their desire to kill Americans and supprot terror rests on one deep, abiding hatred: their irrational fear of America, which sticks up for freedom and opposes their tyranny with great scarafices, like America is doing right now defeating evil in the Arab countries of Iraq and Afghnaistan.   The ideology of militant Islamist terrorism is the totalitarian enemy that America confronts today. And patriotic Americans say it will be defeated like America defeated totalitarianisms in the past through heroic struggle: Communism, fascism, Nazism.   A lot of conservative commentators who speak with moral clarity call America's struggle against the evil of Islamofascist totalitarianism right now World War IV. That this is freedom's fourth struggle against a totalitarian evil. In WWI it was the despotic rule of the Kaiser, in WWII it was the Nazis, in freedom's third struggle it was the communists in the Cold War (although it wasnt a ``hot war`` it was another global stuggle like a world war). Now America's forth stuggle is a worldwide campaign against states like Iraq that hate the free world, kill their own people, desire weapons of mass destruction, and support terrorism.   The antiwar liberal left appeases totalitarian evil, which they love to do. They rallied to defend the Communists in Vietnam. Now the amoral liberal left is opposing America's commander in chief George W Bush in his struggle in Iraq. Hundreds of millions were slaughtered (Communism murdered 100 million people while the liberals opposed the Cold War at every step) and Communism threatened the freedom of America and her allies. Conservatives say that America must stop this new totalitarian enemy before its murderous hate claims as many victims as Communism.    `",0

Even while the neoliberals ofcourse want to put an equal sign between free market and privatization, very few privatizations are ever made that actually increases the competition in the market. Because if the buisness that is sold to private owners has a monopoly before it is sold, it ofcourse will to after it has been privatized. And if the company is sold while it is already subjected to competition it will to after it has been privatized. Indeed, privatization has nothing to do with ``free markets``, but is only a transferment of public property to private hands.

 Axelrosen:  I edited the technical analysis and charting page immediately after it had been merged.  Whoever did the job had linked remarks about technical with the EMH.

"` I've found a misplaced reference showing that ``generatics`` did not start with me in content, only in name. The book, ``Learn from the Masters``, edited by Dwetz, Fauvel, Bekken, Johannsson, Katz (Mathematical Association of America, 1991), says on p. 286, ``It was not until 1894 that J. Tannery introduced the arithmetic of rationals as pairs [vectors] of integers.`` (Jules Tannery (1818-1910), French, is cited ONLINE.)In 1957, I received a grant from the National Science Foundation to organize the first NSF Workshop in Puerto Rico, planned for high math school teachers (some from States). I taught ``Foundations of Mathematics``. I was sent papers (later lost) from previous Workshops. One set described Tannery's work and Hamilton's formulation of complex numbers as pairs or vectors of reals. The formulator filled in by deriving integers from pairs or vectors of natural numbers. The latter shows how ``the law of signs`` derives from CLOSURE on DEFINED DIFFERENCES (DDs) of naturals  (a - b), s.t. subtrahend is not greater than minuend, hence, a natural number. Critical is multiplication law for DD. From standard multiplication algorithm, find that, for DDs, (a - b) * (c - d) = (a*c + (-b)*(-d)) + (a*(-d) + (-b)*c). Applying, 10 = 5*2 = (9 - 4)*(2 - 0) = 18 + (-4)*(2) + 0 = 10, hence, (-4)*(2) must act as a subtrahend -8, leading to ``negative times positive equals negative`` rule. Applying product rule to 30 = 6*5 = (9 - 3) - (7 - 2) = (63 + (-3)*(-2)) - (18 + 21) = (63 - 39) + (-3)*(-2) = 24 + x = 30, hence, x = 6 = (-3)*(-2), leading to ``negative times negative equals positive`` rule. This is forced by CLOSURE on DDs. However, in the ``Generating arithmetic`` article which I initiated, some one put in that CLOSURE is a concept from category theory, very advanceed math. Yet, the above book, on p. 260, says, ``For Galois (1830), Jordan (1870), and even in Klein's ``Lectures on the Icosohedron`` (1884), groups were defined by the one axiom of closure. The other axioms were implicit in the context of their discussions  finite groups of transformations.`` So CLOSURE goes back at least to 1830.Jonhays0`",0

"`  ==Britain==  :When the Romans took control of the largest island they called their possessions Britannia. The earlier celtic inhabitants became known as Britons and the island as Britain. Some centuries after the Romans had left, some of these Britons migrated to the near continent. About 1000 years later (i.e. by the late Middle Ages) the region they had moved to was known as Brittany, and to distinguish the island the term Great Britain was used (compare the French names Bretagne and Grande Bretagne). After the fall of the Roman Empire, the name largely fell into abeyance and tended to be used in an historical sense. Geoffrey of Monmouth used Britannia major and Britannia minor to refer to the island of Britain and Brittany respectively.  Which name fell into abeyance - Great Britain? Geoffrey of monmouth comes before Roman departure + some centuries + 1000 years, so his use of Britannia major (= Great Britain) is the first use of it in the article, not a revival or historical use of a name ``in abeyance``.  `",0

As the Dachshund page was already in place I decided not to mess with it for now.
